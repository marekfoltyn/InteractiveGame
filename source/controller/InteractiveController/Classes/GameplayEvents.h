/**
 * Gameplay events - all "things" that could happen in the game and requires some processing
 * for example: click, packet receive, score point, collision and so on...
 * Each event has own code. Some codes  are based on RakNet packet numbering, but it is not
 * necessary (it is only easier - Box and Event numbering are the same)
 *
 * This file is shared with both the Game and the Controller
